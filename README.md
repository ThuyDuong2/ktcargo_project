## About
- KTCargo Project is an application showcasing the practical application of advanced database management concepts. Through meticulously designed EER diagrams, relational diagrams, and SQL statements, this project brings to life the knowledge acquired in our classes.

- Our primary goal is to create a robust web platform and database for a small yet efficient shipping business that operates seamlessly between the USA, Vietnam, and Europe. The administrative interface empowers users to effortlessly manage customer information, encompassing names, addresses, and contact details. Furthermore, the database intelligently captures crucial shipping and receiving dates, alongside uniquely generated tracking numbers.

- Key Features:

 * Efficient Shipping Routes:
    - USA to Vietnam: Covering Saigon and other provinces.
    - USA to Europe: Encompassing the UK and other EU countries.
 * Versatile Shipping Types:
    - Individual Shipping
    - Commercial Shipping
    - Project Architecture:
  * AREA Superclass: Defines core attributes like tracking number, receiver, normal price, commercial price, and region.
  * Subclasses (EU, UK, VietNam): Inherit attributes from the AREA superclass, providing a structured and extensible foundation.
- The KTCargo Project not only demonstrates the practical implementation of advanced database techniques but also offers a sophisticated solution for a streamlined shipping business, fostering enhanced efficiency and management.
